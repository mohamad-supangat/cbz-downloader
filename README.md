### Supported sites

This is the list of sites cbzdl knows how to download from. The author's main interest is manga hence the heavy manga-oriented support, but any comic hosting site should be supportable.

* Mangakakalot (including manganelo.com)
* MangaFox (fanfox.net)
* MangaHere (mangahere.cc)
* Manga-Here.io (similar name to above, but different site)
* MangaReader.net
* MangaPanda.com

#### Indonesia

* komiku.id

## Installing

You will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and `pip3`

### Linux, Mac

On *nix systems, open a Terminal session and run

	git clone https://github.com/taikedz/cbz-downloader
	cd cbz-downloader

	./install.sh all
	. ~/.bashrc

and the `cbzdl` command will be available to you.

You can update the engine or modules individually by running one of

	./install engine
	./install modules

### Windows

These are instructions for setting up a CygWin *nix compatbility layer and installing `cbzdl` to that. Using native Windows python and creating a globally usable command is beyond this author's knowledge.

Install [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) with the following packages

* python3
* pip/setup tools
* git

Then open a cygwin session and run

	git clone https://github.com/taikedz/cbz-downloader
	cd cbz-downloader
	./install.sh

You should now be able to use `cbzdl` from the cygwin command line, whilst in any folder.

## Using

Two run modes:

	# Download a comic
	cbzdl URL [-s START] [-e END] [-d DELAY]

	# Check for prior failures and exit
	cbzdl URL -f

	# list installed modules
	cbzdl modules

Simply provide a base URL to download from (front page for the comic) - e.g.

	cbzdl http://mangakakalot.com/manga/acaria

To you can specify a start chapter, and end chapter (both optional, as ints or floats)

	cbzdl https://www.mangapanda.com/appearance-of-the-yellow-dragon -s 1 -e 2

`URL` can be literally a URL, or the folder containing the chapters previously downloaded.

If you have already downloaded the comic from the specified `URL`, and you do not specify a start chapter, cbzdl starts again from the last chapter successully downloaded.

By default, `cbzdl` will wait a few seconds between fetching two images (some sites throttle heavy downloaders), depending on the module's recommended delay. You can set the delay manually by providing a `-d DELAY` argument, where `DELAY` is an integer, of how long to pause between page downloads.

You can list available modules by running

	cbzdl modules
